# Backend Development

Backend development refers to server-side development, which handles everything that isn't directly visible to the user on a website or application.

## Key Components of Backend Development

Backend development consists of three main parts:

1. **Servers** – Handle client requests and execute backend logic.
2. **Databases** – Store, manage, and retrieve data.
3. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** – Enable communication between frontend and backend systems.

## Key Responsibilities of Backend Development

✅ Handling user authentication & authorization.  
✅ Managing databases & data storage.  
✅ Processing business logic (e.g., handling payments).  
✅ Serving APIs for frontend applications.

Backend development is crucial for creating robust, scalable, and efficient applications by managing data, security, and business logic.
